### Hi 
Sara Machetts scmachetts@my.waketech.edu

I am creating my first repository for my Wake Tech class

This first assigment consist on creating a repository on gibhub.com and then go to the Gibhub desktop app and clone the repository. 
Then, push your changes to Github and submit the repository URL to your instructor, including the name of the homepage file (usually index.html).
